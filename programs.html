                            <strong>Education</strong> implies a process of learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs.We at Raah Foundation for Enlightening Lives believe that education is a birth right of every human and it is the first and foremost step towards meeting our vision of creating an equitable society. Education plays a vital role in shaping, moulding, sharpening and directing an individual, the society and the nation towards achieving the desired goals.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our educational program  follows a comprehensive approach inclusive of health, finance, legal,career and non-formal as part of the human experience and encourages accepting others who may look, learn, or behave differently from what is familiar to us.Hence with our Education programs we are dedicated to provide comprehensive education to everyone belonging to rural and urban slums of Delhi. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We target those who are left out of the education system mostly youth and women. These youths due to lack of resources are not able to access and afford quality education and are mostly drop outs. We not only provide them formal education but also working towards achieving the goal of their overall personality development. We work with women and do sessions with them. These sessions are focussed towards giving women a platform to discuss their personal issues and ask questions which otherwise they are unable to ask.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We run a number of projects under our Education program. One of our major projects is the Mann ka Dabba campaign. These campaigns are held monthly with some field experts. The experts answer the questions of the community people and aware people about the different issues which are significant for them. Non-formal Education: we are running support classes for school dropouts under NIOS.Health Education: We conduct Workshops on Menstrual Health Management & have conducted around 25 workshops with around 800 women beneficiaries.We have also collaborated with spreading your wings health info comic for the same.We also organise quarterly health services camps.

                        <p>
                            Under this initiative we identify and organize women artisans from the community who are looking for some employment opportunity and want to work on their own. We equip and brush their  skills and undertake sessions on becoming entrepreneurs. We provide them the opportunity to earn livelihood and support their Families. Our program also  provides them Information regarding the welfare schemes and entitlements of the government. We not only provide information about the schemes but also connect them with the government benefits.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Entrepreneurship envision to support and mentor the upcoming entrepreneurs towards their journey and help them to become successful. Towards achieving these goals our program not only provides training, support, mentorship but also links them to financial support for meeting their growth requirements. We also connect with government funding schemes from which they can avail easy loans in less interest. For example we have  multiple exposures and expert discussions as a part of a training program which equips women with the skills they need to run sustainable small businesses and support their families.

                            Educate and practice, that is the only way it can be inculcated into the psyche of people. We all have to contribute to it, not only the government. We all always try to do things in an easier way. But if we first start thinking about our convenience and the environment for any action that we do probably it will help. So, the change has to come in the way people start thinking about it. A few things probably we all develop that will help the environment. So we start with ourselves, our team. We pledge to take a step ahead and come out of our comfort zones by starting to change our own habits first before spreading awareness.Our mantra for the program is to Reduce, Reuse and Recycle.We are running awareness campaigns, drives in the community.There are different kinds of campaigns run on a frequent basis for example community campaigns, media campaigns, rallis, tree plantation drives and promotional campaigns.

                            Equality as are another  E principle, we are uncovering the challenges for Gender inequality  and creating strategies  for change by ensuring equality between women and men a reality.We are providing gender sensitization workshops to both the genders in the community.we focus essentially on participation of both the gender and ensure that both women and men are aware of the benefits that gender equality brings to them as individuals and as members of societies. It is also true that we can only succeed through the participation of both women and men.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Considering that within the gender equality discourse men are underrepresented.They are less likely to participate in events and projects related to gender equality. At Raah Foundation For Enlightening Lives we recognise men as key target groups for its work to raise  awareness of their role as partners in achieving a more gender equal society. Hence we want to make society equitable without ignoring men.We believe in the engagement of community leaders to uncover challenges for gender equality and be participatory in the process of creating strategies for change.Currently we are also running a Good boy fellowship program.
